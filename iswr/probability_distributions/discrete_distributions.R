# Independent replications of a binary experiment are unimportant
# total number of successess (or failures) is random and is called
# the random variable, and is a discrete-valued random variable
# 0, 1, ... , n where n is the number of replications

# a random variable X has a \textit{probability distribution} that can be
# described using \textit{point probabilities} $f(x) = P(X = x)$
# or as the \textit{cummulative distribution function} $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$
# the point probabilities exist on the distribution
# f(x) = \binom{n}{x} = p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}
# known as the \textit{p}binomial distribution with the \textit{p}binomial coefficients
# with the probability \textit{p}

# the \texit{geometric distribution} records the number of failures that
# occur before the first success
